piano interface using javascript and css. css width and height is fixed and not responsive for mobile use.

I used BEM convension for naming css classes and ids.

I used vanilla javascript with mouseup/mousedown events. and keyup/keydown events for keyboard use.
Every time you press a key or click on a key, it downloads the sound and plays it, using javascript. and then it removes the sound. (high speed internet recommended, for a better user experience)
